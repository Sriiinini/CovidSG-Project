# COVID Data Analysis Project - Based on Singapore Data

## Project Overview

Amid the global spread of COVID, countries began disseminating data to the public to track the virus's transmission. Each country introduced its own version of a COVID dashboard, providing real-time insights to help people assess risk and understand local situations.

This project serves as a personal showcase of my contributions during my time in COVID Operations. Meant as a demonstration, it provides a glimpse into the impactful work I undertook and the value I brought to my team. The valuable insights derived from this project provides a good understanding of the pandemic's impact during the period of 2020-2021 in Singapore. 

## Data Sources

- [COVID-19 Singapore](https://data.world/hxchua/covid-19-singapore): Time series data on Covid-19 cases in Singapore
- [Covid-19 Deaths in Singapore](https://data.world/tws4793/covid-19-deaths-singapore): Summary of all deaths attributable to complications from Covid-19.

## Key Highlights

- Using **Python**, I meticulously cleaned and visualized the trends and patterns of COVID cases in Singapore.
- Went an extra mile to utilize Google's Geolocation API for location mapping of COVID Cases.
- Seized the opportunity to learn a new skill: **Power BI** for interactive visualizations.

I hope this project not only reflects my capabilities but also serves as an informative and engaging resource for those interested in the field of COVID data analysis. Happy exploring! üìäüîç
