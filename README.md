# COVID Data Analysis Project - Based on Singapore Data

This project serves as a personal showcase and provides an overview of my contributions during my time in COVID Operations in Singapore. Meant as a demonstration, it provides a glimpse into the impactful work I undertook and the value I brought to my team. The valuable insights derived from this project provides a good understanding of the pandemic's impact in Singapore during the period of 2020-2021. 

Due to the confidential nature of my actual work, I've employed public datasets available online, which sources data from daily Press Releases on the Covid-19 situation in Singapore.

## Data Sources:
- [COVID-19 Singapore](https://data.world/hxchua/covid-19-singapore) - Time series data on Covid-19 cases in Singapore on counts of confirmed, discharged, hospitalised, deaths and imported cases.
- [Covid-19 Deaths in Singapore] (https://data.world/tws4793/covid-19-deaths-singapore) - Summary of all deaths attributable to complications from Covid-19.

## Key Highlights:

- Using Python and Power BI, I've meticulously cleaned and visualized the trends and patterns of COVID cases in Singapore. The interactive visualizations in Power BI offer a comprehensive understanding of the data, allowing viewers to explore and interpret the information easily.

- As part of this project, I seized the opportunity to acquire new skills by learning Power BI. The integration of this visualization software adds an extra layer of depth to the project, showcasing my adaptability and commitment to continuous learning.

I hope this project not only reflects my capabilities but also serves as an informative and engaging resource for those interested in the field of COVID data analysis. Happy exploring! üìäüîç
