# Unveiling Insights of Singapore's COVID Pandemic (2020-2021)

## Project Overview

Amid the global spread of COVID-19, I had the privilege of contributing to the COVID operations in Singapore. While the specifics of my work remain confidential, it was focused towards disseminating real-time data insights. This project serves as a demonstration of the invaluable contributions made during my work stint. The insights derived from this project will provide a good understanding of how the pandemic impacted Singapore from 2020 to 2021.

I've employed public datasets available online, which sourced data from daily Press Releases on the Covid-19 situation in Singapore.

- [COVID-19 Singapore](https://data.world/hxchua/covid-19-singapore): Time series data on Covid-19 cases in Singapore
- [Covid-19 Deaths in Singapore](https://data.world/tws4793/covid-19-deaths-singapore): Summary of deaths attributable to COVID complications

## Key Highlights

- Using **Python**, I meticulously cleaned and visualized the trends and patterns of COVID cases in Singapore.
- Went an extra mile to utilize **Google's Geolocation API** for location mapping of COVID Cases.
- Seized the opportunity to learn a new skill: **Power BI** for interactive visualizations.

I hope this project not only reflects my capabilities but also serves as an informative and engaging resource for those interested in the field of COVID data analysis. Happy exploring! üìäüîç
