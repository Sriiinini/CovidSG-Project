# COVID Data Analysis Project - Based on Singapore Data

Amid the global spread of COVID, countries worldwide began disseminating data to the public to track the virus's transmission. Each country introduced its own version of a COVID dashboard, which provided real-time insights to help people assess risk and understand what‚Äôs happening near them. 

Project Overview:
This project serves as a personal showcase and provides an overview of my contributions during my time in COVID Operations in Singapore. Meant as a demonstration, it provides a glimpse into the impactful work I undertook and the value I brought to my team. The valuable insights derived from this project provides a good understanding of the pandemic's impact in Singapore during the period of 2020-2021. 

Due to the confidential nature of my actual work, I've employed public datasets available online, which pulled data from daily Press Releases on the Covid-19 situation in Singapore.

## Data Sources:
- [COVID-19 Singapore](https://data.world/hxchua/covid-19-singapore) - Time series data on Covid-19 cases in Singapore
- [Covid-19 Deaths in Singapore](https://data.world/tws4793/covid-19-deaths-singapore) - Summary of all deaths attributable to complications from Covid-19.

## Key Highlights:

- Using **Python**, I've meticulously cleaned and visualized the trends and patterns of COVID cases in Singapore. I have also gone the extra mile to utilize Google' Geolocation API to perform location mapping of COVID Cases.

- I also seized the opportunity to learn a new skill: **Power BI** for this project. The interactive visualizations in Power BI offer a comprehensive understanding of the data, allowing viewers to explore and interpret the information easily.

I hope this project not only reflects my capabilities but also serves as an informative and engaging resource for those interested in the field of COVID data analysis. Happy exploring! üìäüîç
