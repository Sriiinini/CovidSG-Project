# COVID Data Analysis Project - Based on Singapore Data

## Project Overview

This project serves as a personal showcase of my contributions during my time in COVID Operations. Amid the global spread of COVID, countries worldwide began disseminating real-time data insights to help the public assess risk and understand local situations.

Since my actual work is confidential, I can't share what I did during my work stint. So, this project acts as a demonstration, offering a glimpse into the important work I did and the value I brought to my team. The insights derived from this project help understand how the pandemic impacted Singapore from 2020 to 2021.

## Data Sources

I've employed public datasets available online, which sourced data from daily Press Releases on the Covid-19 situation in Singapore.

- [COVID-19 Singapore](https://data.world/hxchua/covid-19-singapore): Time series data on Covid-19 cases in Singapore
- [Covid-19 Deaths in Singapore](https://data.world/tws4793/covid-19-deaths-singapore): Summary of all deaths attributable to complications from Covid-19.

## Key Highlights

- Using **Python**, I meticulously cleaned and visualized the trends and patterns of COVID cases in Singapore.
- Went an extra mile to utilize **Google's Geolocation API** for location mapping of COVID Cases.
- Seized the opportunity to learn a new skill: **Power BI** for interactive visualizations.

I hope this project not only reflects my capabilities but also serves as an informative and engaging resource for those interested in the field of COVID data analysis. Happy exploring! üìäüîç
